Notes:

These are some things that we were looking at when we were starting to try to figure out places that we wanted to look at for our loved one.

Food - made on site? ordered in?
Room layout, ward, private, semi
complaints
employment turnover
Doctor, dentist, hair care, foot care
Dementia unit

- Most frustrating thing is that none of the websites show pictures of the actual rooms. I understand not taking pictures of them while someone is living there, but they are occasionally empty.
- Some of the Websites are absolutely terrible. The process of finding the information you're looking for is not easy.
